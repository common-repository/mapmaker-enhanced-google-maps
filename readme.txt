Add incredibly powerful Google Maps with MapMaker: Custom pinpoint graphics, tooltips, per-location photo/video galleries, & more!

== Description ==
The MapMaker plugin enhances Google Maps for WordPress with custom pin-point graphics, limitless locations, tooltips on each location, and photo/video galleries on any location. However, it also allows the use of ANY custom map image of your choosing, all while keeping the great zoom (2 levels of zoom with custom images, unlimited in Google Maps mode) and pan effect of Google maps! 

Note: Mapmaker can be seamlessly upgraded to MapifyPro, an elite mapping plugin that provides unrivaled features. It includes MapMaker's features and over 2 dozen more.

MapMaker allows you to add endless locations to your map. Better yet, it allows you to control what appears when a user hovers over the pinpoints.

Just click around on the map found on the demo for a preview, it's all running on MapMaker!*	**A Powerful & Intuitive Admin:** The MapMaker plugin seamlessly integrates with the Wordpress Admin, allowing you to customize your map and locations with a simple, intuitive interface.
